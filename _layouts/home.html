  <p>
  At one point or another, we may have had things on our resume that were 'less than great'.  It's OK,
  it happens.  I'm sure my current resume is crap. In fact, I know it's way to long.  So, while this site
  may appear to be rude, it's simply an outlet for frustration (for those of us who have to review resumes).

  Also, if you find more, fork the repo and add to the _posts/.  This site uses Jekyll and Github pages, so it's
  easy to add content.
